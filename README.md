# HR Document flow

## Overview

HR Document flow is a module for Odoo 12 that streamlines the document circulation process within an organization. It allows users to upload documents that need signatures, select the type of document and signature, and send it for approval to multiple recipients. Additionally, the module supports adding CC (carbon copy) recipients who will be notified via email for each signature update.

## Key Features

- **Document Submission**: Users can upload documents directly into the Odoo system for further approval.
- **Document Classification**: Select the type of document (e.g., contract, agreement, policy) and the required type of signature (e.g., digital, wet).
- **Approval Flow**: Choose individuals who are required to sign the document from a predefined list of users.
- **CC Recipients**: Option to add CC recipients who will receive notifications for each signature via email.
- **Signature Tracking**: Track the status of document signatures and receive notifications upon completion.
